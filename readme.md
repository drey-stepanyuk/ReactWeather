This weather application has been a great learning experience and I've thoroughly enjoyed working with React thus far. I am currently working on improving the app and converting the weather API to Dark Sky and adding additional styling. 

The following features are used within the application:
* ~~Open Weather Map API~~
* Modals
* Foundation framework
* React framework
* Deployed through Heroku 
* jQuery library
